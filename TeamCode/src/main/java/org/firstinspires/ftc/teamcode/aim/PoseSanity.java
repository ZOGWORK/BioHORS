 * Catches a pose the robot cannot really have. The Pinpoint can report READY and still give a bad
 * pose (a pod knocked loose, a glitch, a wrong reset), and the teleop would aim and fire on it.
 *
 * A pose fails when it is more than OFF_FIELD_MARGIN_IN outside the field, or when it moved further
 * since the last pose it checked than the robot can drive in that time (top speed x elapsed x
 * JUMP_SPEED_FACTOR + JUMP_MARGIN_IN; elapsed counts any loops in between that it did not check, so
 * driving while the pose was unusable is not a jump). A
 * failure is latched: the pose counts as invalid until {@link #reset()} (the teleop's X reset).
 * Field frame, inches. Pure logic: the teleop passes the pose and a clock reading, seconds.
