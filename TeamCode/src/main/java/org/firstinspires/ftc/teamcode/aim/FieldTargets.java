 * Each alliance scores pollen into its OWN hive. A hive has a north and a south cell; one is up
 * and a tip swaps them. A launch only scores from the up cell's own floor quarter, so the aim
 * system picks the cell on the robot's side of the field: north of the hive's centre line (y > 0)
 * the north cell, south of it the south cell. The driver chooses by where they drive.
